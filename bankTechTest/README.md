# Bank tech test

This program creates an account where you can make transactions such as deposits or withdrawals. You can also print your bank statement where you will be able to see all the information about your transactions. 

**How do we do that?**
Initialising an account, you could make transactions using the functions deposit(param) or withdrawal(param) passing the amount of money as a parameter. Also you can initialise a bankStatement(param) which takes the transactions of the account as a parameter, to that you can call the function printStatement to get your statement

## Design

**Account**
```javascript
deposit(amountDeposited)  // amount of money deposited
// makes the deposit 

withdrawal(amountWithdrawn)  // amount of money withdrawn
// if the withdrawal is smaller than the current balance, the transaction is invalid
// makes the withdrawal 

balance() 
// updates the balance after the transactions
// returns balance
```

**Bank Statement**
```javascript
printStatement() 
// returns that array joined(as string)

getStatement()
// stores all the transactions in an array
```

**App**
```javascript
//Initialises the Account and BankStatement, creates transactions and prints the bank statement
```
